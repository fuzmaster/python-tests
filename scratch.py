# This program allows you to enter your credit cards and see how long it will take to pay them off. The goal is for a person to be able to enter information and see how much it would take to pay off their credit card, enter expenses on that credit card, and choose how many months they want to pay it off in. The user can enter their credit card information, any expenses on it, and the number of months they want to pay it off in, and they can change it at any time by bringing it up in a menu system.
